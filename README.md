John Kim 
This is my first project for ECEN5813: Principles of Embedded Software 
Code is designed to compile for three different platform (HOST, BBB, and KL25z)
and so far it has been verified that HOST and BBB can execute without problem.
Version controlling and GNUMake were utilized.

Note: All function descriptions are in header file
